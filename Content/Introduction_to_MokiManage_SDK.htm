            <h1>MokiManage SDK</h1>
            <p>
                The MokiManage SDK provides developers with the ability to quickly and easily integrate their mission critical applications with the MokiManage platform. This gives you the opportunity to manage, monitor, and secure your application with minimal development effort. The SDK is modular and you can determine with components make sense for your solution. The MokiManage SDK components are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1"><b>Application Environment Monitoring (AEM)</b> - This is the core of the SDK. It allows you to determine if an app is running properly and reports on a number of data points including network connectivity, battery level and status, location, device logs, crash reports, running processes, and memory usage. This module also enables app support features like taking a screenshot and pulling the latest device stats.</li>
                <li value="2"><b>Application Settings Management (ASM)</b> - An optional module that enables remote management of application settings. By enabling remote management of application settings, you can change and configure your app on the fly with no user intervention required.</li>
                <li value="3"><b>Compliance</b> - The Compliance module gives you the ability to monitor the security compliance status of the devices where your application is installed. This real-time monitoring enables you to verify if a device has been jail broken, if the operating system is up to date, if unauthorized peripherals are attached to the device, and more. Your application can be built to respond appropriately to changes in compliance like disabling transactions until the device is brought back into compliance.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You’re building a custom application to deliver a great user experience as part of your solution. Enabling your app to work with MokiManage allows you to centralize the management of the user experience you’re delivering with your mission critical app. These guides explain how to fully leverage the power of the MokiManage SDK.</p>
