            <h1>ASM&#160;Programming Guide for iOS</h1>
            <p>App settings management allows you to provide a layout of key / value pairs that can be synced to our website. You can create your own views or use those developed by MokiMobility. The ASM module of the <span class="VariablesMokiManage">MokiManage</span> SDK provides a consistent way for an administrator to control settings for apps across multiple devices from a single, centralized location. ASM&#160;enables developers to specify the settings that they want in their apps, and it then allows those settings to be remotely managed. For example, you could use ASM to create a setting to control or update content in your mobile app, and you could use ASM&#160;to manage that setting across an entire fleet of devices.</p>
            <p>ASM provides a consistent way to manage settings for mission-critical apps. Often there needs to be a way to apply settings to fleets of devices at once, rather than making changes on-site, one at a time. ASM makes the following three things possible for mission critical apps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">A consistent way of handling settings and values.</li>
                <li value="2">Centralized settings management. A way to go to a Web page, define a number of settings, and then have those become active for your app across many devices.</li>
                <li value="3">An option for changing the app settings from the app itself. Ideal for immediate changes directly on that one device</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This section describes how to create your settings schema file, how to activate ASM, and how to update your schema file.</p>
