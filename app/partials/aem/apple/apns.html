The MokiManage platform utilizes Apple Push Notification Service (APNs) to communicate with your application. In
order to send messages to devices on your behalf, you will need to provide the appropriate certificates that you get
from Apple. This guide is not meant to walk you through the steps to obtain those APNs certs. That is well
documented in many places, but here are a couple of useful tutorials that can give you a quick overview in case you
have not been through the process previously:<br/>
