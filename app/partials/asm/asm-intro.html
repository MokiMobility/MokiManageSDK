<h1 class="quickstart typeBlue">Application Settings Management (ASM)</h1>

<p>App settings provide options for how an application should function. For example, by default, the iOS Safari app uses Google to perform Web searches. With ASM, Safari could be remotely configured to use Bing or Yahoo! instead.</p>

<p>On iOS, the Foundation framework provides a mechanism for apps to get and set preferences with the NSUserDefaults class. Within this framework, apps may either display the user settings themselves, or make them available in the Settings app by using a Settings bundle.</p>

<p>The iOS Settings app approach is great for providing a consistent way of managing settings for a single user, but doesnâ€™t meet the needs of a purposed app. With purposed tablets, there needs to be a way to apply settings to fleets of tablets at once, rather than making changes onsite one at a time. ASM makes these three things possible for Purposed apps:</p>

<ol>
<li>A consistent way of handling settings and values.</li>
<li>Centralized settings management. A way to go to a Web page, define a number of settings, and then have those become active for your app across many devices.</li>
<li>An option for changing the app settings from the app itself. Ideal for immediate changes directly on that one device</li>
</ol>

<p>The ASM feature of the SDK provides a consistent way for an administrator to control settings for apps across multiple devices from a single, centralized location, MokiManage.com. Centralizing settings management simplifies the configuration to your fleet of devices.</p>

<h4 class="quickstart typeBlue">Creating the Settings Schema</h4>

<p>The first thing you need to do is define a settings schema for your app: what settings values you need to expose, and what the relationships are between them. The settings schema is expressed in a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file, which you will include with your app:</p>

<pre style="background-color: #f0f0f0;"><code>SettingsSchema.json</code></pre>

<p>Your <code>SettingsSchema.json </code>file can be used for both Android and iOS. However, the updating of settings and presenting the settings in the UI will have to be done differently according to the platform.</p>
